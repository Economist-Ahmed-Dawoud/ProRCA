**ProRCA** is an end-to-end framework for diagnosing anomalies in complex operational environments by uncovering multi-hop causal pathways. Unlike traditional anomaly detection methods that focus on correlations or feature importance (e.g., via SHAP), our approach leverages structural causal modeling to trace the full causal chainâ€”from hidden root causes to observed anomalies.

Inspired by the paper:

   **Beyond Traditional Problem-Solving: A Causal Pathway Approach for Complex Operational Environments**  
   *Ahmed Dawoud & Shravan Talupula, February 9, 2025* `[ðŸ“„ Download PDF] <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01475>`_

This work introduces a methodology that combines conditional anomaly scoring with causal path discovery and ranking. By extending the `DoWhy <https://github.com/py-why/dowhy>`_ library, the framework provides decision-makers with actionable insights into the true source of complex operational disruptions.

Features
--------

- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  Detect anomalies in time series data using ADTKâ€™s ``InterQuartileRangeAD`` via the ``AnomalyDetector`` class.

- **Synthetic Data Generation:**  
  Generate realistic synthetic transactional data with adjustable parameters using ``synthetic_sales_data.py``.

- **Structural Causal Modeling:**  
  Build a causal graph and fit a Structural Causal Model (SCM) using ``ScmBuilder`` in the ``pathway.py`` module.

- **Causal Root Cause Analysis:**  
  Discover and rank multi-hop causal pathways using ``CausalRootCauseAnalyzer``, which combines structural and noise-based anomaly scoring.

- **Visualization:**  
  Visualize causal pathways with Graphviz diagrams, using gradient backgrounds to indicate path importance via ``CausalResultsVisualizer``.
